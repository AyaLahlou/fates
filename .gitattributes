# Repo-wide git configuration file
#
# This file overrides the configurations specified below for all git users that have cloned this repo.
# This is primarily being implemented to allow users to develop code with any operating system (OS)
# preferred and mitigates potential problems with end of line (eol) character differences.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Set the default end of line behavior (i.e. normalization to `lf` upon commit) for all files git recognizes as text
# Note that this *only* applies to newly commited files.  If the file previously existed with a `crlf` end of file
# and was checked out to local, then git will not change the eol character during check in (i.e. commit).
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare to git which files should be normalized (i.e. treated as text files)
*.cdl text
*.F90 text
*.F90_in text
*.mod text
*.py text
*.sh text
*.txt text
*.xml text

# Declare to git which file types are binary files and should not have end of line modified
*.mod binary
