# FATES
------------------------------

This is the developer repository of the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES).  FATES is a numerical terrestrial ecosystem model. Its development and support is enabled by the Department of Energy's Office of Science, through the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment - Tropics ([NGEE-T](https://ngee-tropics.lbl.gov/)) project.

For more information on the FATES model, see our [wiki](https://github.com/NGEET/fates/wiki) and [technical documentation](https://fates-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Important Note:
------------------------------

**Most users should not need to directly clone this repository.  FATES needs to be run through a host model, and all supported host-models are in charge of cloning and loading the fates software.**

FATES has support to be run via the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) or the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).
