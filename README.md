# NGEE-T fates repository
------------------------------

This is the developer repository of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiment Tropicsâ€™ (NGEE-T) model: the Functionally Assembled Terrestrial Ecosystem Simulator (FATES). (https://github.com/NGEET/fates)

For more information on the FATES model, see our wiki:  https://github.com/NGEET/fates/wiki


## Important:
------------------------------

**Most users should not need to directly clone this repository.  FATES needs to be run through a host model, and all supported host-models are in charge of cloning and loading the fates software.**

FATES has support to be run via the Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME) and the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM).
